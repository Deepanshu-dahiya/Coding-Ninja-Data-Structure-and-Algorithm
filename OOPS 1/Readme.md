# **Object Oriented Programming**

Object	 Oriented	 Programming	 could	 be best understood	 with	 help	 of	
an example. Consider	 a	 library	 management	 system. Using	 procedural	
programming,	 the	problem will	be	viewed in	 terms	of	working happening in	 the	
library	 i.e.,	 issuing	 of	 book,	 returning	 the	 book,	 adding	 new	 book	 etc.	
The OOP paradigm,	 however	 aims	 at the	 objects	 and	 their	 interface.	 Thus	 in	
OOP, library management	problem	will	be	viewed	in	terms	of	the	objects	involved.	
Objects	 are	 real	 world	 entities	 around	 which	 the	 system	 revolves.	 The objects	
involved	 are:	 librarian,	 book, member	etc. Hence,	 the	 object-oriented	 approach	
views	a	problem	in	terms	of	objects	involved	rather	than	procedure	for doing it.
