An	important	question	while	programming	is:	#How	efficient	is	an	algorithm	or	piece	
of	code?	
Efficiency	covers	lots	of resources,	including:
• CPU	(time)	usage
• memory	usage
• disk	usage
• network	usage

All	are	important	but	we	are	mostly	concerned	about	CPU	time.
Be	careful	to	differentiate	between:
1.	 Performance: how	 much	 time/memory/disk/etc. is	 actually	 used	 when	 a	
program	is	run.	This	depends	on	the	machine,	compiler,	etc.	as	well	as	the	code	we	
write.
2.	Complexity: how	do	the	resource	requirements	of	a	program	or	algorithm	scale,	
i.e.	what	happens	as	the	size	of	the	problem	being	solved	by	the	code	gets	larger.
Complexity	affects	performance	but	not	vice-versa.
The	time	required	by	a	function/method	is	proportional	to	the	number	of	"basic	
operations"	that	it	performs.
